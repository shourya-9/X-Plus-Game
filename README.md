# X-Plus-Game
A Java program to play the X+Game where two players (a human and the computer) take turns putting tiles on a board having n rows and n columns, and to win the game a player needs to put at least k tiles on board positions forming an X-shape or a +shape. When running the program to play the game the user specifies the value of n and the value of k.
An X-shape is formed as follows:
 There is a center tile and four tiles in adjacent board positions along the four corners of the
center tile 
 There might be additional tiles in adjacent positions to the four corners of the center tile along
its diagonals 
A +shape is formed as follows:
 There is a center tile and four tiles in adjacent positions above, below, to the right, and to the
left of the center tile
 There might be additional tiles in adjacent positions in the same row or in the same column
of the center tile
